## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is to develop a Smart Crop Advisory System in the form of a multilingual mobile application and chatbot that delivers personalized, real-time crop recommendations to small and marginal farmers.

Key features include:

Soil-based advisory using soil test data and government soil health card integration.

AI-powered pest and disease detection via image upload, with recommended remedies.

Weather-integrated insights for irrigation, sowing, and harvesting schedules.

Localized market price updates to help farmers make profitable selling decisions.

Multilingual and voice-based interface to overcome literacy and language barriers.

Offline support for areas with poor internet connectivity.

Feedback loop and analytics to continuously improve recommendations.

## Technical Approach
Data Integration:

Soil health card data, IMD weather APIs, crop history, and local mandi (market) prices.

AI/ML Models:

Pest/disease identification using computer vision (CNNs).

Crop yield prediction using regression and time-series models.

NLP models for multilingual chatbot interactions.

Mobile Application:

Android-first design (as most rural farmers use Android devices).

Voice and text-based UI in local languages.

Backend & Cloud Infrastructure:

Cloud-hosted AI/ML pipelines (AWS/GCP/Azure).

Scalable database for farmer profiles and advisory history.

Security & Privacy:

End-to-end encryption of farmer data.

Compliance with data protection guidelines.

## Feasibility and Viability
Technical Feasibility:

AI/ML, mobile apps, and weather APIs are readily available and proven in agri-tech.

Operational Feasibility:

Can integrate with existing government agriculture databases and extension services.

Simple UI ensures adoption by low-literacy farmers.

Financial Viability:

Supported by government schemes (e.g., Digital Agriculture Mission).

Low-cost cloud hosting and app maintenance.

Potential for public-private partnerships with agri-tech startups.

Scalability:

Can start at the district/state level and scale nationwide.

Modular design allows easy addition of new crops and features.

## Impact and Benefits
For Farmers:

Higher crop yield (20–30% improvement).

Reduced input cost due to optimized fertilizer and pesticide use.

Better income through market price awareness.

For Government:

Improved efficiency of subsidy utilization and agri-extension programs.

Data-driven policy making with farmer feedback.

For Society:

Strengthens food security and promotes sustainable farming practices.

Reduces environmental damage from excessive chemical use.

For Ecosystem:

Opens opportunities for startups, NGOs, and cooperatives to collaborate.
